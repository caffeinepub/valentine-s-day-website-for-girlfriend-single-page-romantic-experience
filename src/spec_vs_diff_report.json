However, the audio asset addition is not evidenced, and several unrelated UI/content changes appear that were not requested.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any new/modified file under `frontend/public/assets/audio/` (or any public asset addition) to confirm the MP3 was added, so AC about avoiding a 404 is not evidenced.",
