Words can hardly capture what you mean to me, but on this Valentine's Day, I want to try. From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. You brought light to my darkest days, laughter to my quietest moments, and love beyond measure.

You are my best friend, my confidant, my partner in all things. Your smile brightens my world, your laugh is my favorite sound, and your presence is my greatest comfort. I am endlessly grateful for every second we share together.

Thank you for being you—for your kindness, your strength, your beautiful heart. Thank you for choosing me, for loving me, for building this incredible life with me.

Today and always, I love you more than words can say.

Forever yours,
Your Name`,
