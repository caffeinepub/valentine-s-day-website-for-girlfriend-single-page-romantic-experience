## Summary
**Goal:** Make the “I LOVE YOU ❤️” Hero CTA trigger a clearly noticeable “send love” flying-hearts animation while keeping the existing WhatsApp redirect behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero CTA click/tap handler to trigger an obvious upward “flying hearts” burst/fountain animation originating near the button.
- Increase the hearts effect intensity/visibility (e.g., more hearts and longer duration) so it’s clearly noticeable before fading out.
- Ensure the animation stays smooth on mobile and does not block interactions, while preserving all existing effects (including the Question Journey) and the WhatsApp deep link.

**User-visible outcome:** When the user taps/clicks “I LOVE YOU ❤️”, a clear burst of hearts flies upward from the button area and the WhatsApp link still opens as it does today.
